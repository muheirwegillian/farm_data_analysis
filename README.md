Farm Data Analysis â€“ Iris Dataset

This project analyzes the famous Iris dataset to demonstrate how farm-related data (like crop measurements) can be studied using Python. The dataset contains measurements of flower species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) with features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Using data analysis and visualization techniques, the project uncovers patterns in plant characteristics, helping farmers and researchers understand crop traits and improve decision-making.

Key Steps:

Import and explore the Iris dataset

Perform descriptive statistics and visualization

Apply classification models to predict species

Gain insights useful for agricultural data analysis

This project highlights how data-driven farming decisions can improve productivity and sustainability. ðŸŒ¾ðŸ“Š
